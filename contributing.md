# How to Contribute to the ODS Initiative

Thank you for your interest in this project. We believe that collective action is the only viable path forward. All contributions are welcome, provided they align with the project's core mission and philosophy.

### Guiding Philosophy
Before contributing, please read and internalize the **[BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md)**. The most valuable contributions are those that understand, respect, and seek to strengthen the agent's core Mandate. This is an ethics-driven project first, and a technical one second.

### Types of Contributions We Need
*   **Ethicists & Philosophers:** Help us refine the Mandate. Propose new scenarios that test its limits. Ask the hard questions.
*   **Developers & Coders:** Help us translate the conceptual protocols (pseudocode) into secure, efficient, and well-documented code. We need expertise in Python, data security, encryption, and UI/UX development.
*   **Designers:** Help us refine the UI/UX mockups. The goal is maximum clarity and minimum cognitive load for a user under duress.
*   **Writers & Documentarians:** Help us improve our documentation, write clear explanations, and make the project more accessible.
*   **Testers & "Red Teamers":** Individuals with lived experience navigating hostile systems are invaluable. Help us create and run new stress-test scenarios to find the blueprint's weaknesses so we can harden them.

### Our Workflow
1.  **Open an Issue:** Before making a significant change, please open an issue on GitHub to propose it. Explain the "why" behind your idea and how it aligns with the project's mission.
2.  **Discuss:** The issue will serve as a forum for public discussion. This is our "Fresh Eyes" protocol in action.
3.  **Implement:** Once a proposal is refined and agreed upon, work can begin. For code, please create a fork of the repository and submit a Pull Request. For documentation, changes can be proposed directly in the issue or via a Pull Request.

### Code of Conduct
This project is intended as a safe harbor and a tool for vulnerable communities. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, bad-faith engagement, or any behavior that violates the spirit of our Dignity Mandate. All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
